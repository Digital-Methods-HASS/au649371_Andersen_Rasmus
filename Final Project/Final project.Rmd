# Using the data to create visualizations
### The data: "Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender"

##### First I define the ggplot with my data, just to try and get myself back into using R. I press ctrl+enter and realise I draw an empty plot, which means I am on the right track

ggplot(data = Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(x = Year,y = Men_elected_to_office))

##### Next I use the cheatsheet to try and see if this coding would be a good way to show my statistics off. I realised though that this looked too messy and it was hard to determine, what the trends were.
ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Men_running_for_office, Men_elected_to_office)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Year)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  coord_cartesian() +
  scale_color_gradient() +
  theme_bw()
  
##### I tried to make a geom_histogram and a geom_area, but realised that this code does not work, because it only works for single statistics.  

a <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Men_running_for_office, Men_elected_to_office))
a + geom_histogram(stat_b)

b <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Year, Men_elected_to_office))
b + geom_area(stat = "bin")

##### I realised that geom_jitter() like was learnt in class would be a good way to show my statistics, but I soon decided on geom_smooth, because it shows an even prettier graph, where the points are connected by a trend line.
c <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Year, Men_elected_to_office))
c + geom_jitter()

##### These four codes are the ones I ended up using for my final graphs, where it shows the trends in women and men running for office and elected to office.
d <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Year, Men_elected_to_office))
d + geom_smooth(model=lm)    

e <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Year, Women_elected_to_office))
e + geom_smooth(model=lm)

f <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Year, Men_running_for_office))
f + geom_smooth(model=lm)

g <- ggplot(Danish_Parliament_2011_to_2019_Gender, aes(Year, Women_running_for_office))
g + geom_smooth(model=lm)

##### I conclude from my visualizations that there have not been any significant change in the last almost 20 years. It has stagnated and moves in zig-zag patterns with no clear sign of change.

##### I tried for 3 hours with this link https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/fig-chunk.html and by watching Youtube videos to try and print my results in the document I knit, however, I was never able to achieve this. This is why the graphs are submitted in Github seperately.
